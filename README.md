# Alice in the Wonderland
 
Task:
Write a program that solves a more general problem: what is the smallest number of pieces of mushrooms that Alice must eat to change her height from the initial x cm to the final height?
y cm. The action of mushrooms is consistent with the original task, while each mushroom produces
made of only eight pieces. So it may be that the expected change in growth will be not feasible.
Attention! Negative growth is not possible!
